/**
 * Letterboxing — the bridge between the detector's square tensor and the real frame.
 *
 * A YOLO-family head takes a fixed square input (640×640 for the reference architecture).
 * A browser viewport is not square. Something must reconcile them, and WHICH something is
 * chosen changes every coordinate the detector emits:
 *
 *   stretch      distorts aspect ratio. A circular icon becomes an ellipse and the head
 *                sees geometry it was never trained on.
 *   crop         discards page content, so elements outside the crop cannot be detected
 *                at all — silently, with no error anywhere.
 *   LETTERBOX    uniform scale, then pad to square. Aspect ratio preserved, nothing lost.
 *
 * Letterbox is the standard choice for this family and it is what this module implements.
 * Its cost is that a detection's coordinates are offset by the padding, and forgetting to
 * remove that offset is the single commonest grounding bug in YOLO integrations. It is
 * also nearly invisible: at 1024×640 the vertical padding is 120 model px, so every box
 * lands about 190 CSS px too low — a plausible-looking wrong answer, not a crash.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE FULL CHAIN, ALL EXPLICIT
 *
 *   model-input px  --(this module: unpad, unscale)-->  capture px
 *   capture px      --(coordinates.ts: scale_to_css)-->  CSS viewport px   CANONICAL
 *
 * Nothing here reimplements the second hop. `coordinates.ts` owns capture→CSS and remains
 * the only place it happens.
