/**
 * VALIDATE + REFRESH — the action-freshness boundary.
 *
 * Implements `docs/architecture/action-schema.md` §"Action freshness — pipeline stage 8" and
 * the decision recorded in ADR-0005. This is the first stage of the execution loop after
 * perception, and it is deliberately the smallest one: pure functions over existing
 * contracts, no network, no model, no secrets, no browser, no DOM.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR
 *
 * Between the screenshot a plan was made from and the click that plan asks for, a page can
 * change. It can reflow, it can disable a control, it can remove one, and it can replace a
 * benign control with a harmful one in the same position. The contract's answer is to
 * re-check four things immediately before acting and, on any failure, to discard the plan
 * and observe again rather than guess. That is what this module does.
 *
 * THE ONLY TWO OUTCOMES ARE `ALLOW` AND `RE_OBSERVE`.
 *
 * There is no "closest candidate", no "best effort", no "allow with a warning". Anything this
 * module cannot establish, it refuses: an unknown safety state is not a safe one. The
 * rejection carries a reason so a ledger can say why, but the decision a caller switches on
 * has two cases and no default that could be mistaken for permission.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT
 *
 * It does not observe, capture, re-plan or orchestrate — the observation loop does not exist
 * yet (AUDIT-0005), and inventing one here would create a second control flow. It does not
 * execute anything: there is no executor in this repository. It carries no value, no literal
 * and no vault token, so no secret can pass through it; SANITIZE and RE-HYDRATE are separate
 * stages and are also unbuilt.
