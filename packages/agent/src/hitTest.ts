/**
 * HIT-TEST AGREEMENT — the TOCTOU gate between VALIDATE and ACT. ADR-0007.
 *
 * VALIDATE proves a target was the right one *at the moment the graph was built*. ACT clicks a
 * point some milliseconds later. Between those two instants a page may open a modal, slide a
 * cookie banner over the control, or move a different element into the same position — and the
 * click is then dispatched successfully to something nobody validated. `page.mouse.click` does
 * not force past actionability, so the event goes to whatever is topmost, which is the honest
 * behaviour and exactly the hole this module closes.
 *
 * It answers one question, immediately before dispatch:
 *
 *     "Is the element I validated the element that is topmost at the point I am about to click?"
 *
 * THE ANSWER HAS THREE VALUES AND ONLY ONE OF THEM PERMITS A CLICK.
 *
 * `MATCH` — the topmost element agrees with the validated target.
 * `MISMATCH` — something else is topmost, or nothing is.
 * `UNKNOWN` — agreement could not be established.
 *
 * **UNKNOWN IS NOT MATCH.** An unestablished fact is not a safe one, so `UNKNOWN` refuses just
 * as hard as `MISMATCH` does. There is no re-target, no nearest candidate, no "click anyway and
 * see": the only two things a caller may do with anything other than `MATCH` are re-observe and
 * give up. That is the same fail-closed shape `validateActionFreshness` already has, for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * THE BRIDGE IS READ-ONLY AND STAYS READ-ONLY.
 *
 * `HitTestBridge` has exactly one method and it returns a description. It cannot navigate, type,
 * evaluate, store or fetch, and it is a SEPARATE interface from `PageActionBridge` on purpose:
 * the ability to ask what is under a point must not come bundled with the ability to click it,
 * and an adapter may implement one without implementing the other. No new browser authority is
 * created here — reading which element is topmost is strictly less than the click ACT already
 * performs.
 *
 * IDENTITY IS NOT THE NODE ID.
 *
 * `NodeId` is positional (`e0`, `e1`, …), so removing an element renumbers every node after it
 * and a stale claim silently rebinds to a different control — measured in MVP-1 demo E. This
 * module therefore compares the **stable DOM reference** (`domRef.selector`, with `nth` where
 * the selector is not unique), the **role**, the **accessible name** and the **geometry**, and
 * it refuses outright when the validated node carries no stable reference to compare. The node
 * id is never used to establish agreement.
