/**
 * What the orchestrator needs from the world, and nothing more.
 *
 * Every capability is an injected port, for one reason: the state machine must be testable without a
 * browser, and must be **incapable** of doing anything it was not handed. It cannot observe a page,
 * click one, or ask a human unless something gave it the means, and the means are all here where they
 * can be counted.
 *
 * THE TWO PORTS THAT CARRY A SECRET, and the asymmetry between them is deliberate:
 *
 * - `observe()` brings values **in**. They go straight to `sanitize()` and into the vault; the
 *   orchestrator never keeps them.
 * - `insert()` puts one value **back**, locally, after privacy and a human have both agreed. It is
 *   the trusted client's restoration step, **not an agent action**. There is no TYPE action, the
 *   value never enters a plan, a permit or the reasoner, and `guardedAct` never sees it.
 *
 * `requestGrant` is the only way a human decision enters the machine. Nothing here can answer it, and
 * a port that returned an approval nobody gave would be fabricating consent — the same trust boundary
 * `recordHumanConfirmation` names, in the same place: the UI that asks.
