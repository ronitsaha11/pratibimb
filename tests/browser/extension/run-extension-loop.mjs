/**
 * M2 — THE REAL PAGE-VALUE BOUNDARY, THROUGH THE REAL MV3 EXTENSION.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DRIVES. A real page in a real tab, read by the content script, routed by the service
 * worker, reasoned about in the offscreen document by the shipped orchestrator, privacy layer,
 * planner, reasoner client and egress guard, restored by a one-shot capability, clicked through
 * `guardedAct`, and verified by reading the page back. No iframe, no `PageAdapter`, no mock.
 *
 * THE THREE ACTS DIFFER BY ONE THING: what is listening at the reasoner's address. An honest front
 * proxying a real local model, a hostile front that answers with a value the client never sent, or
 * nothing at all. The address is the same in all three because the manifest pins `connect-src` to
 * one loopback origin. Nothing in the extension is told which act is running.
 *
 * WHAT IT ALSO PROVES, and this is the half that matters more: the value's path. The page's own
 * field values are read from the DOM by the content script, classified there, and held in a vault
 * there. So the question is no longer "did the value travel safely?" but "did it travel at all?" --
 * and the worker is made to answer it. Every message delivered to the service worker, every message
 * it sends to a tab and every frame on a transport port is recorded in the worker itself, and the
 * whole recording is scanned against the fixture's values at the end. The worker is asked to
 * incriminate itself; the check passes only when it cannot.
 *
 * The capability tests drive the production path: a forged nonce, a reused one, one for the wrong
 * field, one presented after the document under it was replaced, and one presented by a different
 * tab. Then it asks the page itself to reach the core realm, from the page's own world, and watches
 * it fail.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. One run of each act on one machine in one browser cell. That is
 * EXPERIMENTALLY VERIFIED, never PROVEN. And the field values the privacy layer works on are the
 * client's own synthetic details rather than values read from the page -- see the decision record.
 *
 * Usage: CHROME_PATH="<chrome for testing>" node tests/browser/extension/run-extension-loop.mjs
