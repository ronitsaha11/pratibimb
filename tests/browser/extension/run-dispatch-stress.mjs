/**
 * M2-EXEC — ONE APPROVED TASK, ONE BROWSER ACTION. FIFTY TIMES.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The M2 evidence run saw, once in five, ten raw events at the fixture's submit
 * button where one pointer/mouse sequence was expected — while the transport recorded one dispatch,
 * one delivery id and zero refusals. The M2 record called a measurement artefact the "best
 * explanation" and said plainly that this was a hypothesis. A hypothesis is not a finding, and
 * "could not reproduce" is not a root cause. This harness exists to replace both with data.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM `run-extension-loop.mjs`. That runner reads the fixture's own event
 * log and counts entries. Counting entries cannot tell these five things apart:
 *
 *   A. two logical dispatches      — the core realm asked twice
 *   B. two transport deliveries    — the worker carried the same ask twice
 *   C. two browser actions         — the isolated world put events into the document twice
 *   D. two observations of one     — the page recorded a single sequence twice
 *   E. an event from somewhere else — a real user click, or another extension
 *
 * So each of the five is measured separately, at the place it would happen:
 *
 *   A  the run record's own cycle report (one `cycleId`, one `deliveryId`, refusal codes)
 *   B  the service worker's recording of every port frame it carried
 *   C  **the page agent's own fire counter**, read out of the isolated world that fired — a DISPATCH
 *      reply says a dispatch was answered, and only this says how many were performed
 *   D  an independent main-world probe that holds each Event OBJECT in a WeakSet, so the same event
 *      seen twice is a different observation from two events
 *   E  `isTrusted`, which no dispatched event can set, and the page-clock correlation between an
 *      event's `timeOrigin + timeStamp` and the fire note's `at`
 *
 * The fixture is not modified and the existing five-event expectation is not loosened: the probe is
 * installed by this harness, in the page's main world, beside the fixture's own recorder.
 *
 * NO PAGE VALUES ANYWHERE. What is read back is counts, refusal codes, ids minted by the core realm,
 * structural selectors and timestamps. The confirm field is checked by comparing it to the
 * registered one INSIDE the page and reporting a boolean.
 *
 * Usage: CHROME_PATH="<chrome for testing>" node tests/browser/extension/run-dispatch-stress.mjs [--runs 50]
