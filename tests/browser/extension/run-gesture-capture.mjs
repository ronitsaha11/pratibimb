/**
 * M4 — THE REAL GESTURE CAPTURE ROUTE. **HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP.**
 *
 * M3.1 built this route and could not run it. Every automated way of producing the invocation
 * Chrome requires was measured and refused: `<all_urls>` does not substitute for `activeTab`, a real
 * click inside an extension page does not, and a keyboard command dispatched over CDP never reaches
 * Chrome's accelerator table. So the route was implemented, unit-tested with the browser faked, and
 * recorded as NOT YET VERIFIED.
 *
 * This harness closes that by asking a person. It is not automated and does not pretend to be: it
 * launches the browser, opens a page, and then **stops** until someone clicks the extension's
 * toolbar button. Nothing here injects a message, dispatches a synthetic event, or sets a flag that
 * stands in for a grant — the whole point is to exercise the browser's own security boundary, and a
 * boundary you talked your way around is not one you tested.
 *
 * WHAT IT RUNS ON (M23.11, OD-U). **An evidence build, and nothing else:** a DOM-only product build has no
 * capture route and none of the hooks this calls. It also needs `host_permissions: ["http://127.0.0.1/*"]`,
 * no `<all_urls>`, and no `captureVisibleTab` anywhere in the bundle, so this evidence cannot accidentally be
 * taken on the degraded build. `tests/browser/support/build-separation.mjs` decides which build it was given.
 * It refuses to start otherwise, and it never builds one. Until M23.7 this ran on the product build.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROVES, IF IT PASSES. That a person's click produces an `activeTab` grant; that the grant
 * mints an opaque handle; that the handle reaches the offscreen realm as a STRING; that
 * `getUserMedia` and `ImageCapture.grabFrame` turn it into an `ImageBitmap` in that realm; and that
 * the worker's own recording of everything it saw contains no pixels, in that evidence build. It says nothing
 * about a product task, which captures nothing.
 *
 * Usage: CHROME_PATH="<chrome for testing>" node tests/browser/extension/run-gesture-capture.mjs
