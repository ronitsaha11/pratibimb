/**
 * The loopback reasoner service, and the independent record of what arrived.
 *
 * Two processes, both on 127.0.0.1 and nothing else:
 *
 *   client ──HTTP──▶ recording front (8978) ──HTTP──▶ llama-server (8977) ──▶ Qwen2.5-0.5B
 *                          │
 *                          └── writes the EXACT received bytes + their SHA-256
 *
 * WHY A FRONT AND NOT JUST THE MODEL. The payload proof has to be *independent*. The client's egress
 * ledger says "I sent bytes with digest X"; this process says "I received these bytes, and their
 * digest is X". Two parties, computed separately, compared afterwards. A single process printing its
 * own outgoing object would prove nothing — it would be the same belief twice.
 *
 * MODES. The front is also how the refusal and fallback paths are exercised over a real network,
 * without touching a line of security code:
 *
 * - `forward`  — proxy to the model. The real success path.
 * - `hostile`  — answer with a plan containing a raw value the client holds locally. The model never
 *                sees the request. This is a *simulated compromised server*, and it has to be handed
 *                the value by the harness because nothing in the request contains one — which is the
 *                sanitizer's result, not a shortcut.
 * - `malformed`— answer with something that is not a plan.
 * - `down`     — refuse the connection, for the fallback path.
 *
 * THE TRIPWIRE is metadata-only and deliberately secondary. It records that *something PII-shaped*
 * arrived, by class and by where it was seen — never the text. **It is not a privacy guard.** The
 * client refused before sending; if this ever fires on a real run, the client has already failed and
 * the tripwire is how we would find out. A server that had to be trusted to protect the user would
 * be the architecture this project exists to avoid.
 *
 * Usage: node tests/browser/demo/reasoner-service.mjs [--mode forward|hostile|malformed|down]
