/**
 * The demo's loopback server.
 *
 * It serves three things from ONE origin, which is what lets the Planning View and the page it drives
 * be different documents that can still talk: the Planning View at `/`, the synthetic fixture at
 * `/fixture/`, and the **built** packages under `/pkg/<name>/`.
 *
 * SERVING `dist/` IS THE POINT. The page imports `@pratibimb/privacy` and the rest through an import
 * map that resolves to the compiled output the repository builds. So the browser runs the shipped
 * code, not a re-implementation written for the demo. Run `npm run typecheck` first.
 *
 * It is a static file server on 127.0.0.1 with no routes that write, no upload path and no proxy. It
 * is not, and must not be described as, a reasoner endpoint: this phase has no network client.
