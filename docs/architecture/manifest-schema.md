# Redaction Manifest Contract — v1.1, amended to v1.2

> **FROZEN.** Source: dossier v4.0 section 9. **Amended to v1.2 by the owner's M12 decision on
> ADR-0012 §6** (see "Schema v1.2" below). The v1.1 text is kept as the base it amends.
> The brief requires the server to be aware of the redaction scheme, so the scheme is a
> **versioned contract**, not an implementation detail.

## Governing rules

1. The manifest **legend is injected into the server system prompt**.
2. The **TypeScript types are generated from the same Pydantic models the server
   validates against**. There is exactly one source of truth, and it lives on the server.
3. Bumping `manifest_version` is an ADR-level change.
4. All `bbox` values are **CSS viewport pixels** (`docs/architecture/coordinate-contract.md`).

## Schema v1.2 — the amendment (approved M12, ADR-0012 §6)

v1.2 is v1.1 plus exactly three additions, so visual-only masks and the run identity can travel in
the QG-04 body:

| field | v1.2 |
|---|---|
| `manifest_version` | `"1.2"` |
| `capture.format` | `"webp"` with `"q": 62` when the body carries a frame part; `"none"` (and no `q`) when it does not |
| `visual_masks[]` | `{ "region_id": "canvas:N" \| "img:N", "kind": "canvas" \| "img", "bbox": [x, y, w, h] (CSS px), "method": "opaque_fill", "reason": "DETECTED" \| "FAIL_CLOSED:UNAVAILABLE" \| "FAIL_CLOSED:ERROR" \| "FAIL_CLOSED:TIMEOUT" \| "FAIL_CLOSED:MALFORMED" }`. No class, no token, no length, no text |
| `request` | `{ "id": <request id>, "session": <session id> }` |
| `verified` | the structure verifier's verdict. With a frame, `true` only if the frame is `VERIFIED` (ADR-0012 §3), which nothing can produce today, so a frame manifest carries `false` |

- **The parser is strict.** An unknown field at any depth, a wrong type, a non-finite number, a value
  outside its set, an encoded payload or a field named for content (`text`, `value`, `ocr`, `html`,
  `selector`, `url`, `pixels`, …) is refused with its path.
- **The serialization is canonical:** keys sorted at every depth, no insignificant whitespace.
- **`capability.backend`** is `wasm`, `webgpu` or `none` (no local model ran).
- **The implementation:**
  - `packages/privacy/src/manifestV12.ts` (`parseManifestV12`, `canonicalManifestJson`,
    `buildManifestV12`);
  - the body layout is ADR-0012 §4, in `packages/egress/src/handoffContract.ts`.
- **Rule 2 above still describes the target.** No server exists yet (ADR-0012 B4), so until it does the
  client's parser is the reference implementation.

## Field obligations

| Block | Obligation |
|---|---|
| `capture` | Carries the **entire coordinate contract**: `dpr`, `zoom`, `scale_to_css`, `scroll`, `origin`. Never omit a field because it happens to be 1.0 on the dev machine. |
| `capability` | Carries the **live backend** and the tiers that fired. This is what the ledger displays and what the panel is invited to read. |
| `redactions[]` | Each span carries **class, token, box, method, confidence, length and representation hint**, and the field role where useful. `detectors` records provenance — which channels fired. |
| `redactions[].hint` | **This is the mechanism that makes the design work.** It preserves the *type* while destroying the *content*: ten characters, numeric, field role `tel`. The server can still reason about field validation and layout. |
| `elements[]` | `source` is one of `dom`, `vision`, `dom+vision`. Off-screen elements are included with `visible: false, offscreen: true` and **no pixel evidence**. |
| `verified` | Set by the privacy verifier. **The egress guard refuses to transmit unless this is `true`** and the payload hash matches the pin. |
| `goal` | The **user's** stated goal. Never page-derived text. |

## Token format

```
<PII:CLASS:N>
```

- `CLASS` is the detected class (PHONE, AADHAAR, PAN, EMAIL, NAME, ADDRESS, DOB, ...).
- `N` is a per-session, per-class ordinal.
- The same token string appears **in the manifest and rendered in small type over the
  opaque fill in the pixels**, which measurably helps the VLM associate a field with its
  type and label.
- **CRITICAL-class values are masked but never tokenised for server reference.**

Faces use the form `FACE:N`.

## Indian identifier validators (D2)

Format matching alone flags every twelve-digit order number as an Aadhaar. **The checksum
is what makes precision defensible, and precision is a fifth of the score.**

| Identifier | Pattern | Validation that earns the precision |
|---|---|---|
| Aadhaar | `\d{4}\s?\d{4}\s?\d{4}` | **Verhoeff checksum** over all twelve digits |
| PAN | `[A-Z]{5}\d{4}[A-Z]` | Fourth character must be a valid holder-type code. **Note: PAN's final character is a check digit whose algorithm is not public, so this is format plus structure, not a checksum — do not oversell it.** |
| IFSC | `[A-Z]{4}0[A-Z0-9]{6}` | Fifth character is always zero; bank-code table lookup |
| UPI VPA | `[\w.\-]{2,}@[a-z]{2,}` | Handle allowlist — okaxis, ybl, paytm, upi |
| Mobile | `(\+91[-\s]?)?[6-9]\d{9}` | Leading digit constrained to 6–9 |
| Payment card | 13–19 digits | **Luhn checksum** plus issuer range |
| GSTIN | `\d{2}[A-Z]{5}\d{4}[A-Z]\d[Z][A-Z\d]` | State-code table, embedded PAN check, and the **mod-36 check digit** over the first fourteen characters |
| Vehicle registration | `[A-Z]{2}\d{2}[A-Z]{1,3}\d{4}` | State and RTO code tables |
