# Decision — M8.2 QG-03 feasibility for TR-01 and TR-02

| Field | Value |

|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | revision pinned in the registry | ✅ `3cc09f3a` | ✅ `58f4e5b1` |
| 2 | licence read at the pinned revision | ✅ Apache-2.0 (M8.1) | ✅ Apache-2.0 (M8.1) |
| 3 | all four cells filled | ✅ | ✅ |
| 4 | each cell records all four values | ✅ | ✅ |

| 6a | coexistence verified | ✅ 5/5 | ✅ 5/5 |
| 6b | teardown reclaims memory (S-04 meaning) | ✅ 4/4 | ✅ 4/4 |
| 7 | benchmark artifact under `artifacts/benchmarks/` | ✅ `M8.2-text-region-qg03.json` | ✅ |
| 8 | ADR if a pinned default changed | not triggered by feasibility; **required at adoption** | not triggered |
| | **verdict** | **PASS** | **FAIL** |

| cell | TR-01 | TR-02 |
|---|---|---|
| Chrome WASM | ACCEPT | ACCEPT |
| Chrome WebGPU | ACCEPT | ACCEPT |
| Firefox WebGPU | CONDITIONAL (headless: no GPU adapter at defaults, as the UI head) | CONDITIONAL (same) |
| **Firefox WASM (Linux)** | **ACCEPT** | **CONDITIONAL** (headless 2/3) |
| Firefox WASM (Windows) — supplementary | CONDITIONAL (headful 2/3, same symptom) | ACCEPT |

WebGPU cells must be filled, not passed. QG-03: *"A model that fails them [the WASM columns] is not
shipped whatever it does on WebGPU."*

## The failure, stated precisely — and why the verdict is not changed

TR-02's failing launch showed liveness and never reported. The protocol fixed in advance that *"a
launch that never reports is a failed launch, never a smaller denominator"*. Changing that now,
after seeing whom it affects, would be the retrospective fitting the owner prohibited.

What was learned about it, recorded and deciding nothing:

1. **The symptom is not candidate-specific.** TR-01 hit it in the supplementary Windows cell.
2. **The mechanism is established experimentally.** In Firefox 155.0.1 at release defaults, the
   MV3 event page does not let a probe running past the background idle timeout report. The same
   probe at warm=40 failed **4/4** at defaults and succeeded **4/4** with only
   `extensions.background.idle.timeout` raised, for both candidates
   (`logs/diagnostic-firefox-event-page-lifetime.json`). No completed recorded Firefox probe ran
   longer than 28.0 s.
3. **The harness design exposed it.** One launch ran ~26–28 s of continuous computation with no
   extension event, close to that limit. TR-02's probes take longer than TR-01's, because of a
   larger declared input and ~560 ms against ~470 ms per inference. So its launches sat nearer the
   limit, and they were **not** protected from it.
4. **The failing launch's own cause was not directly observed.** It is consistent with, and
   reproduced by, the mechanism above.

**The same weakness applies to TR-01's PASS.** Its Linux launches ran up to 27.6 s and happened
to complete. Its PASS is valid under the protocol as frozen, but it rests on a harness that was
not robust to this Firefox behaviour. The owner should weigh that as much as TR-02's FAIL.

## A second deviation — Firefox on Windows updated itself

The protocol froze Firefox 155.0.1. **Windows Firefox updated itself to 156.0.1** at
18:50:27Z. The recorded Firefox-Windows launches began at 18:50:05Z, and every one reports
`rv:156.0`. The **Firefox WebGPU** cell, the supplementary Firefox WASM (Windows) cell, and the
Firefox-Windows teardown and coexistence runs are therefore **156.0.1** measurements. The
**Firefox WASM (Linux)** cell ran **155.0.1** as frozen. Nothing was re-run or recomputed because
of it. It is disclosed in `README.md` and `logs/environment.json`.

## What this authorises

- Recording **TR-01** as **`ELIGIBLE FOR ADOPTION REVIEW`** in the registry and the feasibility
  matrix, with the two deviations attached.
- Recording **TR-02** as **QG-03 FAIL** on this run, with its exact reason, in the same places.
- Citing W1's figures for either candidate **as W1 figures**.

## What this does not authorise

- Adoption, `ADOPTED` in the registry, or any product integration. Adoption review is a separate
  owner decision.
- Changes to `TextFinding`, `OCRProvider`, the extension, the manifest, permissions, capture,
  egress, actions, the vault or the privacy boundary.
- Any claim of product visual-only PII protection, full recall or zero leakage.
- Re-running a failed cell, or changing the harness to rescue a verdict, without the owner.

## Owner decisions required next

1. **TR-02's FAIL.** Accept it as recorded, **or** authorise a protocol amendment. An amendment
   would change the harness so no launch approaches the event-page idle limit, for example by
   splitting a launch's work into shorter units. That is harness mechanics, not a threshold. Under
   it, the **Firefox WASM (Linux) cell would be re-run for BOTH candidates** under the same
   amendment. Re-running TR-02 alone would be a rescue.
2. **The Firefox version.** Accept the Windows cells as 156.0.1 evidence, or require a re-run on a
   pinned build with updates disabled. That needs an owner-approved system/browser policy change on
   W1 (Firefox's `DisableAppUpdate` policy), which I have not made.
3. **TR-01 adoption review.** TR-01 is eligible. Adoption would require:
   - the `OCRProvider` ADR (a detector-only producer and a new pinned default);
   - the `TextFinding` fail-closed "unread, therefore sensitive" state;
   - the product post-processing matching the screened DB variant;
   - mask application to pixels;
   - end-to-end revalidation.

   **None has been started.** Knowing TR-01 shares its network with the rejected PP-OCRv5 remains
   part of that review.

## Next milestone

Depends on decision 1:

- **If the amendment is authorised:** **M8.2a**. Re-run the Firefox WASM (Linux) cell for both
  candidates under an amended, pre-registered harness. Every other cell and result stands.
- **If not:** **M9 — adoption review for TR-01.** This is the ADR, not integration.

## Amendment 2026-10-02 — W2 real-frame baseline (owner decision)

**Decision:** establish a formal W2-specific M8.2 real-frame baseline. Keep `dev`. Preserve the
measured W1→W2 `dev` difference explicitly. Preserve all W1 evidence byte for byte. Establish TR-02
on W2 in the same operation.

**What this amendment does NOT change:** detector thresholds, detector model, preprocessing, crop
geometry, privacy logic, scoring logic, or any product behaviour. No verdict above is revised.

| Statement | Status |
|---|---|
| M8.2's native reference behaviour is **machine-local** | **ESTABLISHED** — onnxruntime returns a different output for a byte-identical tensor and model on a different CPU; `min`/`max` identical, summations differing at ~1e-7, deterministic per machine |
| W1 evidence remains **historical and immutable** | **HELD** — `results/tr-01-run1.json`, `logs/fixture-integrity.json` and the conversion records are unchanged |
| W2 has a **separate validated baseline** | **ESTABLISHED** — `logs/w2-baseline-tr-01.json` (native + WASM stages) and `logs/w2-baseline-tr-02.json` (native stage) |
| Byte-identical cross-machine native output is **not assumed** | **ENFORCED** — the baseline is resolved per workstation |
| Exact equality remains **mandatory within a workstation** | **ENFORCED** — byte equality for tensors, deep equality for boxes and scores; nothing relaxed |
| An unknown workstation **fails closed** | **ENFORCED** — `loadBaseline` refuses; there is no fallback |
| `dev` is **retained**, its 2.1013 px W1→W2 difference recorded | **DONE** — [`logs/baseline-divergence-w1-vs-w2.md`](logs/baseline-divergence-w1-vs-w2.md) |
| TR-02 **WASM stage on W2** | **NOT ESTABLISHED, reported** — no product harness runs the rollback candidate through ORT WASM; completing it means re-running M8.2's own browser cells on W2 |
| M8.2's own browser cells on W2 | **NOT RUN** — `build-extension.mjs` refuses on any workstation but W1 rather than emitting a reference whose WASM comparison is empty |
| The real gesture route on W2 | **NOT RUN** — `run-gesture-redaction` and `run-stream-re1` were exercised on the degraded dry-run route, which the harnesses label as NOT gesture evidence |

**Privacy, measured on W2 and unchanged from M8.1:** RE-1 scores identical field for field, redaction
masks identical, 0/306 sensitive glyphs exposed, every RE-1 gate passing.
