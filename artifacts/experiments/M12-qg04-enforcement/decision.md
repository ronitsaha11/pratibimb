# M12 — decision record

**Verdict:**

- **QG-04 enforcement infrastructure: BUILT AND VERIFIED.**
- **Production frame egress: IMPOSSIBLE**, by three independent locks. **QG-04: UNSIGNED.**
- **J7 / B5: OPEN.** **B7: OPEN** (F-M12-1).

## Owner decisions applied (M12 brief, 2026-10-01)

| # | decision | applied as |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The taxonomy RAW_FRAME / SANITIZED_RGBA / SANITIZED_WEBP / ATTESTED_FRAME_ARTIFACT / QG04_WIRE_PAYLOAD; never interchangeable | Distinct types. Only `attestHandoffBody` makes a wire payload, and only from a verified handoff and an untampered MaskVerifiedFrame. |
| 2 | Only VERIFIED may authorize frame egress; MASKED_LOCAL, MASK_VERIFIED, DETECTOR_VERIFIED, BLOCKED and REFUSED never do | `FRAME_EGRESS_STATE = "VERIFIED"`; the attested states are STRUCTURE_ONLY and MASK_VERIFIED; there is **no VERIFIED constructor**. DETECTOR_VERIFIED is not promoted, and Invariant E is unchanged. |
| 3 | Manifest v1.2 approved | `packages/privacy/src/manifestV12.ts`, with a strict parser and canonical serializer; `docs/architecture/manifest-schema.md` amended |
| 4 | Multipart: manifest (JSON), then frame (WebP), plus body hash and request-id | `buildHandoffBody` and `validateQg04Request` |
| 5 | Production origin UNCONFIGURED | `PRODUCTION_HANDOFF_CONFIG.origin = null` → `CONFIGURATION_MISSING`. No loopback, IP or placeholder is used as production config. |
| 6 | Authentication undefined | `authentication: {state: "NOT_CONFIGURED"}`, the only state the type allows → `AUTHENTICATION_NOT_CONFIGURED`. No credential and no key. |
| 7 | The M10/M11 loopback stays test-only | `sendMaskVerifiedFrame` is reachable only from test-build probes. The product imports only `sendVerified` (structure JSON). |

## Findings

- **F-M12-1 (B7):** ADR-0001's CSP restricts `connect-src`, `script-src` and `object-src` only.
  - Code injected into the offscreen document reached an independent foreign origin through `<img>`
    and `<iframe>`, and could POST to the pinned loopback.
  - No product code does so (static gate, bundle scan).
  - It bounds what code running in the realm can do, and it is the open part of B7.
  - **Needs an ADR** amending the approved CSP (e.g. `default-src 'none'` with the needed sources).
    It also needs a decision on whether a product build should pin the test collector `127.0.0.1:8995`
    at all.
- **F-M12-2 (B5/J7):** on real gesture-stream frames at device scales 1, 1.25, 1.5 and 2:
  - RE-1 G1–G3 pass on all six held-out images, with **0 / 1224** sensitive glyphs exposed.
  - **G4 fails at 1.25 (H4) and 1.5 (H3).** Three captures of the same displayed image gave different
    boxes, though the detection count was stable.
  - The product route is CSS-capped (scaleToCss 1 at every scale). The device-to-CSS downscale changes
    the boxes by up to 3.017 px between scales and against M8.1's screenshot boxes.
  - Formal run 1 did not record how far the later passes moved. The harness now records it for a
    run 2.
  - **The existing criteria are not met; J7 is not closed.**

## Blockers after M12

| # | before | after M12 |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | no production origin | **OPEN** (by owner decision 5) |
| B2 | no verifier returns VERIFIED | **OPEN** |
| B3 | manifest v1.1 cannot carry visual masks | **RESOLVED:** v1.2 approved and applied |
| B4 | no server | **OPEN.** An isolated request parser exists (`validateQg04Request`); there is no server. |
| B5 | J7 open | **OPEN:** G4 failed on stream frames (F-M12-2) |
| B6 | authentication undefined | **OPEN** (by owner decision 6) |
| B7 | no network gate and no interception suite | **PARTIAL:** the source gate and interception suite are MET; **F-M12-1 open** |

## Next owner decisions

1. **F-M12-1:** amend ADR-0001's CSP to close non-`connect-src` channels, and decide whether the
   product build pins the test collector origin.
2. **F-M12-2 / J7:** either authorize a stream RE-1 run 2, which now records per-pass movement, to
   characterise the non-determinism; or rule what evidence would close J7 given a CSS-capped route
   (ADR-0012 §14.6).
3. **B2:** a verifier that can return VERIFIED (an OCRProvider under QG-03), which remains the gating
   decision for any frame egress.

## Amendment 2026-10-02 — J7 on W2

**J7 ran on W2** (real gesture, four device scales, three passes, 72 observations). Evidence:
[`logs/w2-cft-stream-re1.json`](logs/w2-cft-stream-re1.json); analysis:
[`logs/w2-j7-stream-determinism.md`](logs/w2-j7-stream-determinism.md). W1's records are untouched.

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| G1 zero exposed sensitive glyphs | **PASS 24/24** — 0 of 1,224 sensitive glyphs exposed |
| G2 over-mask within budget | **PASS 24/24** (max 0.3755) |
| G3 no blanket box | **PASS 24/24** (max 0.0504) |
| G4 deterministic across passes | **FAIL 1/24** — DPR 1.0 / H1, `maxPassDeviationPx` 1.2519 |
| **B5 / J7** | **STILL OPEN** |
| F-M12-2 | **reproduced on W2**, narrower (1 of 24 rather than 2 of 4 windows) |

**No security gate failed** (G1–G3 all pass), so M13's stop condition on those does not apply. G4's
failure is recorded, not corrected.

### Two things J7 now needs, neither of them a tuning change

1. **Per-pass frame digests.** The evidence schema records no hash of the captured frame, so the
   repository cannot tell an inference/runtime determinism issue from a capture/rasterisation
   difference — the distinction J7 turns on. Adding it requires a harness change and a fresh formal run
   with four more human gestures.
2. **An owner ruling on `scaleToCss ≠ 1`.** The product route caps the stream to CSS size, so the
   condition J7's text names cannot be produced by the route the product uses. M12 already asked for
   this ruling; it remains outstanding and W2 does not change it.

**Carried over, not re-run:** G5 (WASM validity vs native — a runtime property, not a capture-route
property) and G6 (no plaintext output — structural, unchanged).
