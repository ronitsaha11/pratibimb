/**
 * The demo, wired up.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL HERE. All of it. The page is a real page in a real same-origin frame; the observation,
 * sanitization, verification, egress, plan parsing, validation, binding, grant, rehydration, permit,
 * hit test, dispatch and result verification are the shipped packages. The reasoner is a real
 * Qwen2.5-0.5B answering over real loopback HTTP, behind a boundary built so that replacing it
 * changes nothing after it.
 *
 * THE THREE BUTTONS ARE THE SAME CODE PATH. Success, compromised reasoner and model outage differ
 * only in **which reasoner answers and at what address** (`demoScript.ts`). There is no demo-only
 * branch anywhere below this file, no mode the security layers can see, and no UI-only refusal: act
 * two is refused by the same `validatePlan` → `checkLiteral` act one passes through, and act three
 * reaches the same permit gate act one does.
 *
 * WHY THE HOSTILE REASONER HAS TO BE HANDED THE NUMBER. It cannot obtain it from the handoff — the
 * handoff contains no values, which is the thing being demonstrated. So the harness reads the
 * registered number out of the local DOM and gives it to the simulated attacker. That necessity is
 * the evidence, and the UI says so rather than hiding it.
 *
 * WHAT THE SCREEN SHOWS DURING A RUN, AND HOW IT KNOWS. The orchestrator returns its record only when
 * the run ends, but the story a judge follows — the boundary filling in, the model planning, the
 * approval request — happens before that. So three READ-ONLY TAPS watch the ports as the pipeline uses
 * them: the first page reading, the verified handoff a reasoner is given, and the grant request. They
 * pass every call through unchanged and alter no argument or result. Each catches its own rendering
 * errors, because an exception thrown inside `propose` would be read by `sendToReasoner` as
 * `REASONER_THREW` and trigger a fallback — a display bug silently changing what the system does.
 * When the run ends, the record replaces everything the taps saw.
