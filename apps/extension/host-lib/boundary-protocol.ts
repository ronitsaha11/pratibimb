/**
 * THE MESSAGE SCHEMA FOR THE PRIVACY BOUNDARY — and what it is built to make impossible.
 *
 * The page's values are read, classified and held in the content script's isolated world. The
 * orchestrator, the reasoner and the egress guard are in the offscreen document. Everything the two
 * say to each other crosses the service worker, so this file is where "no raw value crosses" has to
 * be true, and it tries to be true **by construction** rather than by care:
 *
 * - **There is no `value` field anywhere in these types.** Not optional, not `unknown`, not a
 *   `Record<string, unknown>` something could be tucked into. Adding one would be an edit to this
 *   file, which is the point of keeping them here and nowhere else.
 * - **What goes down** is a value-free element graph, references, targets, identities and grants.
 * - **What comes up** is redaction spans, scrubbed element names, descriptors, a view of field
 *   classes, and counts — plus, for a question asked of the vault, a class and a boolean.
 * - **What is never in either direction** is a form value, a vault entry, or the text of anything
 *   the vault recognised.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THAT MUST NOT CROSS IN THE OPEN is a literal a reasoner returned, because in the
 * refusal case that literal *is* the page's value, arriving back from a hostile peer. So it does not
 * travel as a message: the core realm arms a capability, the worker carries a nonce, and the page
 * realm collects the text as a **reply** — the one direction MV3 offers that the worker cannot read.
 * See `value-release.ts`.
 *
 * A SCHEMA IS NOT AN ENFORCEMENT, so it is not the only one. `page-privacy-boundary.ts` runs every
 * outgoing message past its own vault before sending it, and refuses to send anything the vault
 * recognises. The types say what may cross; the scan proves what did.
