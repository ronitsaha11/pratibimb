/**
 * THE PRIVACY BOUNDARY, WHERE THE PAGE'S VALUES ARE.
 *
 * This runs in the content script's isolated world — the same world that already reads the page for
 * the transport, and the only world in this extension that can hold a form value without it being
 * in a message the service worker receives. `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` is delivered to **every**
 * listening context; `background.ts` has a line whose only job is to say "not for me", and that line
 * is the proof. So the values stop here.
 *
 * WHAT IT OWNS, all of it from `packages/privacy`, none of it reimplemented:
 *   - the **vault** — one per run, memory only, destroyed when the run ends;
 *   - **classification** — `classifyObservation`, which is `sanitize()`'s first half;
 *   - **the leak oracle** — `holdsLiteral`, answered for text the core realm asks about;
 *   - **rehydration** — `rehydrate()`, every check in order, then one local write.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT OWN. It assembles no manifest, verifies no payload, sends nothing to a network,
 * parses no plan, mints no permit and clicks nothing. The core realm keeps all of that, and this
 * world stays a place values live rather than a place decisions are made. A content script is the
 * realm closest to the page and therefore the one to trust least with authority — it holds the
 * secrets precisely because it is the only realm that can, not because it has earned anything.
 *
 * THE OUTGOING SCAN IS THE ENFORCEMENT. Types say what may cross; `withoutHeldValues` proves what
 * did. Every reply this boundary sends is serialized and run past its own vault first, and a reply
 * the vault recognises is **not sent** — it becomes a refusal naming a class. That check uses the
 * same `holdsLiteral` the verifier and the egress guard use, so there is one answer to "is this a
 * secret?" in the whole system.
