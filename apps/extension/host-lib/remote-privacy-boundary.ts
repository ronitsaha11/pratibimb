/**
 * THE PRIVACY BOUNDARY AS THE CORE REALM SEES IT — a `PrivacyBoundary` over a message channel.
 *
 * The offscreen document runs the orchestrator, the reasoner and the egress guard. The page's
 * values are in the content script's isolated world and stay there. This is the adapter between
 * those two facts, and it is an adapter: it classifies nothing, holds no vault, and decides nothing
 * that `packages/privacy` does not decide.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSEMBLES, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A SECOND SANITIZER. `sanitize()` is the composition of
 * `classifyObservation` → `buildHandoffDraft` → `verifyHandoff` → ledger. The page realm runs the
 * first, because it needs the values. This runs the other three, in that order, on this side —
 * because `verifyHandoff`'s first check is that a draft came from the sanitizer, and a handoff
 * shipped in as data would have lost that. Assembling here from value-free parts keeps the check
 * real: **the realm that will send the bytes is the realm that verified them.**
 *
 * THE ONE ROUND TRIP THAT CARRIES TEXT is a question for the vault, and it does not travel as a
 * message. A literal a reasoner returned may *be* the page's value — that is exactly the case the
 * check exists for — so it goes through a one-shot capability: the worker carries a nonce, the page
 * realm collects the text as a reply, answers with a class and a boolean, and the worker sees
 * neither the question nor anything but the verdict.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE CAN RELEASE A VALUE. `releaseInto` sends a reference and a target; the value is
 * already in the realm it is going to. Read the return types: there is no member anywhere in this
 * file that a value could occupy.
