/**
 * THE PRODUCT LOOP'S PORTS, OVER THE REAL EXTENSION TRANSPORT.
 *
 * `apps/demo/src/pageAdapter.ts` gives the orchestrator a page by holding a `Document` in the same
 * realm. The extension cannot: the core realm is the offscreen document and the page is in a tab,
 * with a service worker between them. This file supplies the same four ports from that distance, and
 * it supplies them by **delegating to the existing transport** rather than by reimplementing any of
 * it. Nothing here measures an element, chooses a point, or decides anything.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGES ACROSS THE DISTANCE, AND WHAT MUST NOT:
 *
 * - `observe()` is `observeBoundDocument`, which reads only the document the binding names and gives
 *   every reading a new frame id — which is what VERIFY RESULT requires and what a same-realm
 *   adapter has to remember to do by hand.
 * - `documentId` is the **browser's** attestation, not a marker this code wrote into the page. That
 *   is strictly better evidence than the demo's: a reload changes it whether or not we are watching.
 * - `bridges` is one `TransportCycle`, created once, which looks once and acts once. A second look
 *   or a second act refuses inside the transport, so replay is not a policy this file enforces.
 * - `insert()` **refuses**. It is the port for writing a literal a reasoner supplied, and this
 *   client has no way to carry one to the page that the service worker would not read — so it does
 *   not carry one at all. A reference-backed restoration does not come through here: it goes to the
 *   privacy boundary, where the value already is. The agent gains no arbitrary write primitive.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE. No fetch, no classifier, no vault, no planner, no permit, no consent. The
 * reasoner, the grant prompt and the release authority are all handed in.
