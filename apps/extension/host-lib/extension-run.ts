/**
 * ONE TASK, RUN FROM THE OFFSCREEN DOCUMENT, THROUGH THE REAL EXTENSION.
 *
 * This is the demo's `apps/demo/src/main.ts` with the same parts in the same order and a different
 * page underneath it: the page is in a tab, reached through the content script and the service
 * worker, instead of a same-origin frame in the same realm. Everything between `runTask` and the
 * click is the shipped packages, unmodified and unwrapped.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS ALLOWED TO DECIDE: nothing. It chooses which reasoner is asked and at what
 * address — the two things a deployment chooses — and it holds the lifetimes, which ADR-0008 §5
 * leaves open and which therefore have to be stated somewhere. Every refusal in the run belongs to
 * a package.
 *
 * THE THREE ACTS DIFFER BY ONE THING. Not a flag, not a mode, not a branch: **what is listening at
 * the reasoner's address**. An honest front, a hostile front, or nothing at all. The security path is
 * the same object graph in all three, which is the claim the evidence has to be able to make.
 *
 * WHY THE ADDRESS IS ALWAYS THE SAME ONE. The manifest pins `connect-src` to a single loopback
 * origin (ADR-0001 §7.2), and M1 does not widen it. So the acts share an address and differ in what
 * answers there — which is closer to a real outage than three addresses would be.
 *
 * WHERE THE PAGE'S VALUES ARE. Not here. They are read, classified and held in the content
 * script's isolated world, and this realm is handed a `PrivacyBoundary` onto that world rather than
 * a vault. Nothing in this file, in the orchestrator, in the planner, in the reasoner or in the
 * egress guard ever holds one — which is checkable by reading what `createRemotePrivacyBoundary`
 * is able to return.
 *
 * THE HUMAN. `requestGrant` is left pending until something outside this realm answers it. Nothing
 * here can answer it, the reasoner cannot reach it, and the service worker only carries the answer.
 * In an automated run the operator answers through the harness, exactly as the demo rehearsal's
 * `auto` mode does — and M1 does not claim to have built a human-facing grant surface.
