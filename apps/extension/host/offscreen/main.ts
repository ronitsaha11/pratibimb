   * so an evidence run can compare the element graph the core realm actually receives against the
   * one the demo's in-process PageAdapter produces. It is the same control-plane shape as `E6_ARM`:
   * **service worker only** (`sender.tab` is refused), so a content script cannot ask the core realm
   * to observe on its behalf, and a page cannot reach it at all.
   *
   * NO PAGE VALUE CROSSES. `observePage` returns the transport's own vocabulary — selector, role,
   * accessible name, geometry, visibility — which `contracts.ts` already bounds (TR-10, INV-21).
   * There is no field for a form value here and none is read.
