/**
 * M3 — WHAT THE VISUAL TIER IS STRUCTURALLY INCAPABLE OF CARRYING.
 *
 * The three-act harness checks what actually crossed on a real run, by scanning the worker's own
 * recording, the reasoner's received bytes and the egress payload. These are the other half: rules
 * over the types and the source, which catch a mistake before a browser is ever launched and which
 * hold for inputs no fixture happens to produce.
 *
 * The distinction that matters most here is the one the file exists to protect. `PerceptionSummary`
 * is what leaves the realm that holds the pixels. Every field in it is a count, a code, a geometry
 * or a timing — so a leak is not a check that has to pass, it is a shape that cannot be built.

 * M3.1 — VISUAL EVIDENCE STAYS VISUAL EVIDENCE.

 * question is not whether that noise exists but what the system is allowed to do with it.
 *
 * The rule these tests hold is one sentence: **a box only pixels assert may be counted, and may not
 * become anything a plan can name or a vault can hold.** Provenance is a discriminated union rather
 * than a confidence number for exactly this reason — after averaging, "the DOM says a field is
