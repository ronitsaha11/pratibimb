# Blocker Register — PratiBimb

> **Every blocker is listed here, including the ones that are inconvenient to admit.**
> A blocker is anything that stops a defined next action from being taken. It is not a risk
> (see `agentos/templates/risk_register.md`) and it is not an open `UNKNOWN`
> (see `agentos/registry/feasibility-matrix.md`) — a blocker is specific, current, and has
> a named resolution path.
>
> Read after `agentos/state.md`. Updated whenever one changes state.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `OPEN` | Active. Work is stopped or degraded and the resolution path is available to us. |
| `BLOCKED` | Active, and the resolution path depends on something we do not control. |
| `RESOLVED` | Cleared, **with evidence recorded**. Never set on the strength of an expectation. |
| `WAIVED` | Consciously accepted, by a named human, with the cost stated. |
| `DEFERRED` | Real, but not on the critical path yet. Carries a review date or trigger. |

**A blocker is never marked `RESOLVED` without an artifact.** Per `AGENTS.md` §5,
documentation asserting a thing is fixed is not evidence that it is fixed.

### B-01 · Firefox absent — S-02 cannot run

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | **`RESOLVED` 2026-09-07** |
| **Owner** | Human — workstation owner |
| **Resolution evidence** | Firefox **155.0.1** installed via `winget Mozilla.Firefox` on workstation 2. **S-02 executed against real Firefox** — no simulation, no inference from Chrome. Verdict **ACCEPT**, 3 runs of 3, artifact `artifacts/experiments/W1-S02-firefox-webgpu-context/`. Acceptance criteria were **not** altered after seeing results; the pre-registered protocol is preserved in the same file. |
| **Residual** | **Firefox on LINUX is still `UNKNOWN`** — a separate cell, and the one the risk register rates High. Tracked as **S-02a**, not as part of B-01. |
| **Dependency** | Mozilla Firefox installed on a workstation available to the project |
| **Impact** | **Critical, on the critical path.** `agentos/workflows/spike.md` states *"Nothing else in the project starts until S-01 and S-02 resolve."* S-01 has an answer; S-02 has none, and cannot be attempted. By the project's own gating rule, downstream implementation does not begin. |
| **Evidence** | `artifacts/environment/ENV-0002-workstation-omen-audit.md` — Firefox not installed; Chrome 152 and Edge 152 present |
| **Resolution path** | Install Firefox → run S-02 on `spike/firefox-webgpu-context` per `artifacts/experiments/W1-S02-firefox-webgpu-context/README.md`. The protocol, acceptance criteria and harness plan are already written, so the spike is a same-day task once the browser exists. |
| **Update 2026-09-07 (S-02a, Linux)** | **S-02a executed on real Firefox 155.0.1 inside WSL2 Ubuntu 26.04. Verdict CONDITIONAL, and the cells stay separate.** At release defaults `navigator.gpu` is **ABSENT** — in the MV3 event page *and* the ordinary-page control, headful and headless, 3/3 each — so it is a platform default, not an extension-context restriction. With `dom.webgpu.enabled=true` it works fully: adapter, device, element-exact compute (0 mismatches), clean teardown, 3/3. The pre-registered rule makes that **CONDITIONAL, never ACCEPT**. Evidence: `artifacts/experiments/W1-S02a-firefox-linux-webgpu/`. |
| **Residual after S-02a** | **Firefox on NATIVE Linux is still `UNKNOWN`** (S-02a-1). WSL2 is not native Linux: no `/dev/dri`, **0 Vulkan ICDs**, `llvmpipe` for OpenGL — so the forced-on result is almost certainly **software-backed**, and Firefox exposes no adapter identity to confirm it. **`nvidia-smi` working is the CUDA compute path, not graphics.** The Windows `ACCEPT` is **not** upgraded into a universal Firefox ACCEPT. |
| **Explicitly not done** | S-02 has **not** been emulated, approximated, or inferred from the Chrome result. A Chrome measurement is not a Firefox fact. |

### B-02 · Invariant E enforcement mechanism (2) has a measured coverage gap

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | `OPEN` |
| **Owner** | `privacy-security-engineer` → human architect (ADR required) |
| **Dependency** | An architectural decision on how mechanism (2) is enforced |
| **Impact** | **Critical.** `docs/security/security-invariants.md` requires four enforcement mechanisms for Invariant E, all four. Mechanism (2) — a Playwright interceptor asserting zero requests — **does not observe or block requests from the MV3 offscreen document**, which `docs/architecture/constitution.md` §5 makes the send path. A suite built on `context.route()` would go green while data left the machine. **QG-04 cannot be signed off on the current plan.** |
| **Evidence** | `artifacts/experiments/W1-S01b-playwright-extension-loading/` — 3 runs of 3, abort-everything route handler, offscreen POST reached the collector every time. CDP sees the target; Playwright does not surface it. |
| **Resolution path** | ADR choosing a vehicle. Candidates measured or identified so far: CDP-level `Fetch.enable` attached to the offscreen target; an independent loopback arrival assertion (which is what caught this). **Both change how a frozen invariant is enforced, so neither may be adopted without human approval.** |
| **Update 2026-09-07 (B-02-1, Linux)** | **Two of the three gaps are closed; B-02 stays `OPEN`.** The model was re-run inside **WSL2 Ubuntu 26.04**, headful and headless: 66 runs, every cell unanimous, **headless identical to headful**. CDP auto-attach observes and genuinely blocks; the `late-attach` race reproduces on Linux (false green 10/10) and `setAutoAttach` + `waitForDebuggerOnStart` closes it (10/10); Playwright-only enforcement produces a false green (6/6). Evidence: `artifacts/experiments/W1-B02-1-linux-observation/`. **New and important: CDP auto-attach does NOT fail closed on its own.** With `Fetch.enable` skipped while attachment succeeded, it reported nothing while the payload reached the wire (3/3) — indistinguishable from a clean run. **Only the independent collector caught it.** The collector is therefore not redundancy; it is what makes the pair fail-closed. |
| **Update 2026-09-10 (ADR-0001 implementation)** | **The regression guard was re-run against this branch and still passes — 3/3 runs reproduce the false green, `playwrightNowSeesIt: 0`. B-02 stays `OPEN` and gains nothing from it.** The guard is on our methodology, not on the blocker, so a pass here means the ground truth still works, **not** that mechanism (2) has been resolved. Recorded because the run was necessary for an unrelated reason: adding `"type": "module"` to the new root `package.json` reclassified every archived CommonJS harness as ESM and the guard stopped executing entirely (`ReferenceError: require is not defined`) — a standing invariant guard that had silently become unrunnable. Fixed with a CommonJS boundary over `artifacts/experiments/`. Evidence: `artifacts/adr/ADR-0001/b02-regression-guard.json`. |
| **Still open** | The **real CI cell is `UNKNOWN`** — `ubuntu-latest` resolves to **`ubuntu-24.04`** and this ran on Ubuntu 26.04 under WSL2 (different release, different kernel, no GPU, no WSLg on a runner). And the **B-02-2 ADR is unwritten**. QG-04 stays unsigned. |
| **Explicitly not done** | The invariant was **not** weakened, the assertion was **not** relaxed, and moving the egress module out of the offscreen document to suit the tooling is rejected as a direction. |
| **Update 2026-10-01 (M12)** | **The B-02 observation pair is now a standing harness for the frame path. B-02 stays `OPEN`.** `tests/browser/extension/run-qg04-interception.mjs` attaches raw CDP to the offscreen document and the worker (`Network` domain, observation only, no `Fetch` blocking), and watches the test sink plus an **independently instrumented foreign origin**. In the product build, every `connect-src` primitive injected into either realm gave 0 foreign arrivals. In the evidence build, every refused frame state, forgery, raw frame, malformed payload and fallback gave 0 requests, and the one permitted test send gave exactly 1. **New for mechanism (3), finding F-M12-1:** injected code reached the foreign origin through `<img>` and `<iframe>`, because the ADR-0001 policy restricts `connect-src` but not `img-src` or `frame-src`. No product code does this. Closing it needs an ADR on the CSP. **Still open:** the B-02-2 ADR on the vehicle and the CI cell. Evidence: `artifacts/experiments/M12-qg04-enforcement/`. |
| **Update 2026-09-09 (S-02a-2a-1)** | **Mechanism (3) is now load-bearing for more than it was.** S-02a-2a-1 measured that the `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` CSP token places **no restriction on WASM provenance** — network-origin bytes compile and stream-instantiate as freely as packaged ones, 36/36 across two browsers and three contexts. The only manifest-level control over where WASM may come from is therefore **`connect-src`**, which is Invariant E mechanism (3). **The CSP decision (issue #17) and this blocker now share a file and must be decided together.** New question **S-02a-2a-4**: does a pinned `connect-src` actually block WASM from another origin, in all three contexts? Evidence: `artifacts/experiments/W1-S02a2a1-csp-attack-surface/`. |
| **Update 2026-09-10 (S-02a-2a-4)** | **Mechanism (3) is now MEASURED rather than assumed.** A pinned `connect-src` blocks foreign-origin WASM at the **network retrieval layer, before the wire** — 0 arrivals at an independently instrumented foreign origin across Chromium 151 and Edge 152, 36/36, with an unpinned positive control recording 18 arrivals per browser to prove the observer works. Also measured: the **SHA-256 pin accepted foreign-origin bytes**, so `connect-src` and hash-pinning are orthogonal and both are required. **B-02 stays `OPEN` — this touches mechanism (3), and the blocker is about mechanism (2), which is unchanged and still has its interception gap.** Evidence: `artifacts/experiments/W1-S02a2a4-connect-src-provenance/`. Decision package: `docs/adr/ADR-0001-wasm-csp-and-connect-src.md` (**PROPOSED, not approved**). |
| **Update 2026-09-07 (B-02 spike)** | **A candidate mechanism is now identified and measured — the blocker stays `OPEN`.** `artifacts/experiments/W1-B02-invariant-e-observation/` compares four mechanisms over five cases. **CDP `Fetch` attached to the offscreen target observes 5/5 and genuinely blocks** (the collector confirms zero arrivals); an **independent loopback collector** proves arrival, catches an unauthorised sender by its missing provenance headers, and **caught a tampered payload by recomputing SHA-256 over the received bytes**. Playwright, told to abort everything, blocked none while the payload reached the wire. `M2 + M3` covers all five sub-questions with independent failure modes. **Not adopted:** the CI cell (`ubuntu-latest` + Playwright's own Chromium) is unmeasured, M2's target-discovery race is untested, and adoption changes how a frozen invariant is enforced — which needs an **ADR**. A deterministic **regression guard** now encodes the false-green failure mode, 3 of 3 runs. |

### B-03 · No vLLM host — server-side work has nowhere to run

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | `BLOCKED` |
| **Owner** | Human — team decision |
| **Dependency** | A machine that can run vLLM, and a decision about which machine it is |
| **Impact** | **Major, not yet on the critical path.** The dossier schedules the first server round trip in week one (S-07) and closes the loop in week four. vLLM's supported platform is Linux. The second workstation has **neither Docker nor WSL**, so it has no vLLM path at all; the first workstation has Docker but 8 GB of VRAM, which ENV-0001 assesses as tight for Qwen3-VL-4B before KV cache. |
| **Evidence** | `artifacts/environment/ENV-0002-workstation-omen-audit.md` (no Docker, no WSL); `artifacts/experiments/ENV-0001-workspace-environment.md` (E-01…E-04) |
| **Resolution path** | Name the GPU host, then run E-01 (does vLLM run there at all) and E-02 (does Qwen3-VL-4B fit, at what quantisation and context) on a dedicated branch. |
| **Update 2026-09-07** | **A Linux host with GPU passthrough now exists on workstation 2 — and B-03 still stays `BLOCKED`.** WSL2 + Ubuntu 26.04 were installed (kernel `6.18.33.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2`), **no reboot required**, and `nvidia-smi` works inside the distribution: RTX 5050, 8151 MiB, CUDA 13.1, with `/usr/lib/wsl/lib/libcuda.so` present. Evidence: `artifacts/environment/ENV-0003-wsl2-linux-gpu-host.md`. **The host existing is not vLLM running on it.** The next obstacle is named rather than guessed: Ubuntu 26.04 ships **only Python 3.14**, with no `python3.12` in apt and no `pip`, which is outside the interpreter range vLLM publishes wheels for. A pinned Python toolchain is required before E-01 can even be attempted. The 8 GB VRAM question (E-02) is unchanged. |
| **Update 2026-09-13 (ENV-0004, E9)** | **Still `BLOCKED`, now for a sharper reason.** The *Impact* field above ("the second workstation has **neither Docker nor WSL**") has been stale since ENV-0003; it is left as written and corrected here. ENV-0004 links the W2 WSL2 guest to `LAPTOP-SRCINK2B` by GPU UUID (`GPU-acde8e3a-c29b-9943-557e-04dd0b20a09a`) and records that **pip is now present** in the guest while Python is still **3.14.4 only** and **vLLM is not installed**. `artifacts/experiments/E9-server-feasibility/` stopped at the weight-download boundary (no approval recorded) and established one fact without a run: the published **BF16** `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct` weights total **8,887,292,732 B**, larger than the **8151 MiB** of either workstation's GPU. The vendor **FP8** checkpoint totals 6,036,505,569 B and its fit at E1's context is UNKNOWN. **Resolution now requires an owner decision on which quantisation is "the frozen model"**, then download approval, then E-01/E-02. |
| **Wider value** | This is the project's first Linux environment, so it also bears on two p1 items that have nothing to do with the server: **B-02-1** (does the Invariant E interception result hold on the real CI cell?) and **S-02a** (Firefox on Linux, rated High by the risk register). Both may now be runnable for the first time. **WSL2 is not `ubuntu-latest`** — different kernel, different graphics stack, no GPU on a hosted runner — so it narrows the gap without closing it. |
| **Explicitly not done** | No model weights downloaded. No attempt to force a vLLM deployment onto a machine that cannot host it. **The current workstation is not described anywhere as the server host.** |

### B-04 · Fork-topology contributors cannot merge their own pull requests

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | `ACCEPTED — will not fix` (was `BLOCKED`; see the 2026-09-10 update) |
| **Owner** | Human — repository owner (`ronitsaha11`) |
| **Dependency** | Either a maintainer merges, or the contributor is granted write access |
| **Update 2026-09-10 — VERIFIED LIVE, partially stale** | **The blocker as originally written is no longer accurate, and the half that remains is narrower than stated.** Re-checked against the live API rather than carried forward: `gh api repos/ronitsaha11/pratibimb --jq .permissions` from the **`ronitsaha11`** session returns `{"admin":true,"maintain":true,"push":true,"triage":true,"pull":true}`. B-04's claim that *"both authenticated identities have `pull` only"* was true of the session that filed it, and is **false for the repository owner**. Demonstrated rather than asserted: PRs **#23** and **#25** were merged from this session, and `main` branch protection was applied. **What remains true:** `gh api .../collaborators` lists **only `ronitsaha11`**, so `Lakshya172` is not a collaborator and still cannot merge their own PRs or have workflow runs start without maintainer approval. **Status stays `BLOCKED` for the fork-contributor half only.** Resolution is a permissions grant, which is the repository owner's decision and was **not** taken autonomously. |
| **Impact** | **Major, process-level, and it has two halves.** (1) Work can be branched, committed, pushed, evidenced and opened as a PR, but **not merged**; open PRs accumulate and no checkpoint tag can be cut, because tags come from merged `main`. (2) **CI does not even run.** GitHub holds workflow runs on pull requests from a first-time fork contributor in `action_required` until a maintainer approves them, and approving requires admin. So "required checks are green" — the third condition of any merge policy — is **unreachable from the fork side**, not merely unmet. |
| **Evidence** | `gh api repos/ronitsaha11/pratibimb` → `{"admin":false,"maintain":false,"push":false,"triage":false,"pull":true}` for both authenticated identities. `gh pr merge 1` → `GraphQL: Lakshya172 does not have the correct permissions to execute MergePullRequest`. `gh run list` → PRs #2 and #3 both `action_required`, duration `0s`, zero check-runs. `POST .../actions/runs/<id>/approve` → **HTTP 403 "Must have admin rights to Repository."** |
| **Resolution path** | Repository owner (a) approves the held workflow runs so CI reports, (b) merges reviewed PRs — **or** grants write access to the contributing account, which resolves both halves at once. |
| **Update 2026-09-07** | **Half two is cleared in practice.** The owner approved the held runs; CI now reports on fork PRs and PRs #2 and #3 both went green. **Half one stands:** the contributing account is still `pull` only, so it still cannot merge or cut a tag. The owner merged PR #1 (`2fb4e82`) and PR #3 (`09aa71b`), which demonstrates the workflow functions **with the owner as merger** — that is Option A, working. Whether to stay on Option A or move to Option B is still an open human decision. |
| **Update 2026-09-10 — DECIDED: Option A, permanently** | **The open human decision above is now taken. `Lakshya172` is NOT granted write access, and repository permissions are left unchanged.** The project is executed from the owner's side, so the fork-contributor path that B-04 describes is no longer on the critical path — nothing is waiting on it. This is a deliberate decision to stay on Option A (owner as merger), **not** an unresolved grant still pending: `gh api .../collaborators` continues to list only `ronitsaha11`, by choice. **Status moves to `ACCEPTED — will not fix`.** Should a fork contributor become active again, this decision is revisited by the owner and by no one else; no agent may grant repository permissions. |
| **Interim mitigation** | Every CI job is reproduced locally on each PR head and the verbatim output is posted as a PR comment, so a reviewer has the evidence even while the hosted run is held. **This is a substitute for visibility, not for CI**, and it is not represented as a passing hosted run anywhere. |
| **Explicitly not done** | No attempt to route around the permission model, no use of a second identity to obtain access it does not have, and **no PR reported as merged that was not merged**. |

### B-05 · `main` has no branch protection, and `agentos/state.md` claims otherwise

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | `OPEN` |
| **Owner** | Human — repository owner (`ronitsaha11`) |
| **Dependency** | Repository settings; requires admin |
| **Impact** | **Major.** `docs/operations/git-workflow.md` §2 says *"`main` is protected and release-quality"* and PR #1 adds a line to `agentos/state.md` asserting *"protected: PRs required, force-push and deletion blocked, `Governance and secret hygiene` a required check"*. **None of that is configured.** A claimed control that does not exist is worse than a known absent one, because reviewers stop checking. The same `state.md` line also calls the repository **private**; it is **public**. |
| **Evidence** | `gh api repos/ronitsaha11/pratibimb/branches/main/protection` → **HTTP 404 Not Found**. `gh repo view --json isPrivate,visibility` → `{"isPrivate":false,"visibility":"PUBLIC"}`. |
| **Resolution path** | Owner enables branch protection on `main` (require a PR, require the `Governance and secret hygiene` check, block force-push and deletion) **and** the two false claims in `state.md` are corrected in a follow-up PR once PR #1 merges. |
| **Update 2026-09-07** | PR #1 was merged at `2fb4e82` with the two false claims still in it, so they reached `main`. They are now corrected forward in a follow-up PR — the original wording stays in the file's history, and the correction says what was wrong and how it was verified. **The documentation half is therefore closing. The substantive half is not: `main` is still unprotected**, and that needs admin. Re-verified after the merges: `gh api repos/ronitsaha11/pratibimb/branches/main/protection` → **404**. |
| **Explicitly not done** | The claims were **not** corrected by rewriting PR #1's branch or its merged commits. Forward-moving correction only, per `docs/operations/git-workflow.md` §5. |

### B-06 · Line endings are unmanaged; a `.sh` file committed from Windows will break CI

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | `OPEN` |
| **Owner** | `integration-release-engineer` |
| **Dependency** | None — operational, resolvable without an architectural decision |
| **Impact** | **Minor now, latent.** There is no `.gitattributes`. PR #1 commits CRLF blobs for `scripts/verify-repo.py`, `agentos/state.md` and `agentos/registry/feasibility-matrix.md`, which on `verify-repo.py` turns a 3-line semantic change into a 237-line whole-file diff — reviewable only with `--ignore-cr-at-eol`. Nothing is broken today because CI invokes `python scripts/…`. **The latent failure is a shell script**: `scripts/check-secrets.sh` committed with CRLF fails on `ubuntu-latest` with `bash: \r: command not found`. |
| **Evidence** | `git cat-file blob` on both branches — `main` blob CR count 0, PR #1 blob CR count 238. No `.gitattributes` tracked. |
| **Resolution path** | Add `.gitattributes` normalising text to LF (guard against new damage), then renormalise the tree in a separate, clearly labelled commit **after PR #1 merges**, so the renormalisation diff never contaminates a review. |

---

## Resolved

### B-00 · Workspace was not a git repository

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | `RESOLVED` |
| **Evidence** | `ronitsaha11/pratibimb`, 10 commits, tag `v0.1.0-foundation` at `7a31857`, CI green |
| **Note** | Recorded as blocker 1 in `agentos/state.md` before the repository existed. Retained here for continuity of the record. |

---

## Not blockers, deliberately

Recorded so they are not re-raised:

| Item | Why it is not a blocker |
|---|---|
| No product code exists | Intended. CI actively asserts `apps/` and `packages/` do not exist during the spike phase. |
| 20 feasibility cells `UNKNOWN` | Intended. They are filled by S-08…S-27, and nothing has been claimed about them. |
| Playwright's browser CDN returns HTTP 400 here | An obstacle to *local* egress-suite runs on one workstation, not to the project. Recorded in `W1-S01b/environment.json`; folded into B-02's evidence. |
| Chrome 152 refuses `--load-extension` | A measured browser behaviour, recorded in S-01 and reproduced in S-01b. It constrains tooling choices; it does not stop defined work. |
